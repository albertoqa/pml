> I had been impressed by the fact that biological systems were based on molecular machines and that we were learning to design and build these sorts of things.  K. Eric Drexler

Most of the material here is based/copied from the book ["Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book) which I highly recommend!

Any code found here might be directly from the book, mine, or a mix.
